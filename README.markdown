# About
## Abstract
AHOY is an event-based simulation environment designed to test networked multi-agent systems. Through user-defined, interchangeable component models, the effectiveness of different combinations of software agents, network configurations, and sensors can be tested in real-world environments. Scenario definitions specify a high-level model of a simulation's attributes, allowing for nondeterministic experiment progression. Real-time execution enables the integration of human interaction with the simulation. The distributed simulation engine provides the ability to run large-scale, complex experiments, reducing the cost of otherwise economically infeasible experiments.
