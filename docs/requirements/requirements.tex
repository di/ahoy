\begin{abstract}
STAGE provides the capability to test the veracity of system-level sensors and component-level algorithms in the laboratory against virtual operations using data from simulated sensors and nodes. These nodes work with scripted or real time data, depending on the user's need. This network and sensor testbed allows users to independently vary its topology, application suites, and the environment. It also emulates the communication between these components. A visualization tool is provided to the user for demoing and analyzing.

\section{Introduction%
  \label{introduction}%
}

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection{Purpose%
  \label{purpose}%
}

This requirements document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the STAGE project.  These requirements include, but are not limited to, the performance, interfaces, and hardware goals and limitations.  The information presented here is intended for the development team and the external stakeholders, currently Dr. William Regli, Mr. Joseph B. Kopena, Mr. Joeseph P. Macker, and The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory.

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection{Scope%
  \label{scope}%
}

The goal of the STAGE project is to allow for the testing of agents working together on seperate nodes across multiple scenario and topology situations.  STAGE allows the user to examine how effectively nodes (with agents running on them) interact with one another.  This includes network connections between nodes, the fidelity of these connections, and the proficiency of the agents to process and transmit data.

STAGE consists of six main components: Visualization, Topology, Scenario, Agent Framework, Distribution Framework, and the API.  The Visualization allows the user to see what is happening in the emulation.  For example, network links and their strength, movement of nodes in the virtual world, as well as the movement of non-agent world objects all have a visual representation over a map of the world.  The Topology is a scripted language that defines interfaces and network connections on each node.  It also describes any changes in the network that do not result from mobility.  The Scenario is a scripted language that defines the location and mobility patterns of each node and non-node world object. It also handles the timing of events. An Agent Framework indicates the agent(software) running on each node and permits different algorithms to be tested on different nodes.  The Distribution Framework helps to distribute the emulation across multiple physical nodes in a cluster.  An API is also provided to allow the user to interact with the emulation.  For example, it allows a user to trigger outside events or query information being generated by the emulation. 

Users of STAGE are researchers looking to improve or test their current agent/network interactions across different topology and scenario combinations.

\subsection{Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations%
  \label{definitions}%
}

\begin{description}
\item[Agent]
	Agents are emulated pieces of software that run on nodes in the network. They consist of different algorithms that are relevant for the user to test on different scenarios and topolgoies.   

\item[Distribution]
	Distribution refers to the process of distributing the emulation across a multi-platform physical cluster.  This allows the system to exceed the number of nodes per platform for a single emualtion at the system's discretion.  A framework will be provided to allow the user to distribute their eumulation. 	

\item[Node]
	Nodes are virtual or physical machines that consist of agents and network interfaces.  If nodes are virtual, many nodes may run on one physical machine.  

\item[Scenario]
	Scenario is comprised of a scripted language indicating the location and mobility patterns of any emulated nodes within the virtual world. These nodes consist of agents (see definiton of 'Agent') and non-agent world objects such as planes, boats, ground vehicles, etc. 

\item[Terrain]
	Terrain refers to the simulated landscape running in the emulation.  This includes such geography as the slope of the land, the tree density, water v.s. land surfaces, etc.

\item[Topology]
	Topology refers to the network topology between nodes. It is described with a scripting language.  This language specifies the details of network interfaces on each emulated node, including radio models and throughput characteristics.  It describes any physical or wireless links that connect these interfaces.  Further, it indicates changes in linkage over time such as a wireless interface switches wireless LANs or a physical link being created or severed. 

\item[Visualizer]
	The Visualizer allows the emulations to be superimposed over real-world topography.  This permits the user to be able to examine the behavior of the agents.  It also allows for overlays such as link quality, traffic rates, or other metrics deemed important to specific components

\section{Overall Description%
  \label{overall-description}%
}

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection{Product Perspective%
  \label{product-perspective}%
}

STAGE is used as a testbed for sensors and respective algorithms in the laboratory against virtual operations using data from simulated sensors and nodes. The ability to independently and quickly vary the network topology, application suites, environment, or any other variable is essential to collect data which would be cost-prohibitive to produce in a real-world scenario. Furthermore, the visualization tool is used for conceptual demonstrations.

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsubsection{System Interfaces%
  \label{system-interfaces}%
}

STAGE combines:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Scenario Language - Defining the entire scenario in a very simple language
    \item Agent Framework - Supporting the customization of semi-intelligent agents
    \item Topology Creator - Creating a virtual topology of nodes defined in the Scenario Language
    \item Distribution Framework - Distributing a large-scale emulation across numerous physical machines
    \item Data-Collection API - Collecting all relevant data through a simple API
    \item Visualization Engine - Conceptually visualizing terrain, node movement, link status, etc.
\end{itemize}

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsubsection{User Interfaces%
  \label{user-interfaces}%
}

STAGE's user interface is two-fold, with each interface for different tasks and uses. The basic interface allows a user to simply and quickly define a scenario with the Scenario Language and begin an experiment, using the API to collect data in a way that is defined by the user. The Visualization Engine allows the user to interpret the experiment visually, without a need for data-collection or the API.

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces%
  \label{hardware-interfaces}%
}

STAGE requires that the machine running the system has one to many network interfaces to support distribution.

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces%
  \label{software-interfaces}%
}

STAGE requires the use of Linux Namespaces' kernel virtualization as well as OpenGL in order to use the visualizer.

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsubsection{Memory Constraints%
  \label{memory-constraints}%
}

STAGE requires a machine with at least 4GB of RAM.

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsubsection{Site Adaptation Requirements%
  \label{site-adaptation-requirements}%
}

STAGE requires that the system is configured per-site to create a distributed emulation, or to interact on-the-fly.

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection{Product Functions%
  \label{product-functions}%
}

This software is a testbed, where the user specifies an environment, network configuration, and applications to run in the scenario. Each of these items may be varied independently.

The general function of this software is to run a simulation.  The software collects data as it runs, which can then be used to evaluate the combination of simulation settings. 
This data is particularly helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the applications being tested in the scenario.

There also exists a visualization component of the software. It is useful for quickly gauging the current simulation state, though is not required for running the simulation.  The visualization uses data from the environment configuration to display various types of terrain.

The simulation runs in real time.  This allows for realistic simulations, where humans may interfere with self-directing agents in the application. There exists other simulation software which can display a scripted demo, however, this does not allow for realistic human intervention.  Real-time simulations are necessary for training simulations.

The specified environment contains terrain data and static world objects, so that it may mirror existing real-world locations.  This is useful for testing the effectiveness of agent behavior in real-world situations, such as trying to get rovers to secure a given range of city blocks in Philadelphia. Though it may be of some benefit to test this with random mazes, it is more useful to test in an environment that models the existing world.

The user specifies the initial network configuration, i.e. the types of connections and which agents are connected in the simulation.  This network is simulated, and its configuration may change over time. For example, if two agents that have a Wi-Fi connection move too far apart, their connection ceases to exist. 

%___________________________________________________________________________


\subsection{User Characteristics%
  \label{user-characteristics}%
}

The system has four different types of users.  Each type of user has different goals and needs to use different parts of the system.  These user roles, while they may be performed by the same user, are here split into the four distinct roles for clairty:

complete the tasks below:

\begin{itemize*}
    \item Distribute agent instances to multiple physical machines
    \item Abstract the physical links from the simulation
    \item Coordinate data collection after simulations
\end{itemize*}
%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection{Constraints%
  \label{constraints}%
}

The system is able to interpret and/or process any agent or topology it is given.  If this isn't possible for any reason, the system informs the user of this. No piece of this system requires elevated privileges.

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies%
  \label{assumptions-and-dependencies}%
}

It is assumed that a user, administrator, or developer has the ability to install required libraries which will named in the future as a result of the development process.

    \paragraph{Custom Topologies} The system provides a means for users to create custom topologies.
    \paragraph{Custom Agents} The system provides a means for users to create custom agents.

\subsection{Testing%
    \label{testing}%
}
All code with in the system must be tested. Core functionality of the software has 100\% code coverage with automated unit and integration tests.  The visualizer testing is done manually as it is a smaller component and would otherwise require a disproportionately large investment in initial setup.  Unit tests cover the algorithms used in our system while integration tests are used to test our data-flow.  

\section{System Evolution}

With more time, the STAGE team could create additional tools to aid in the the development of more complex agents or topologies, so that user customization does not become too granular.  Furthermore, tools which can automate or assist in data collection and parsing could be implements.  Even further development could lead to a platform that included Windows or other operating systems.
