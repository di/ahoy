\begin{abstract}
STAGE is an event-based simulation environment used to compare the effectiveness of different combinations of software agents, network configurations, and sensor data in real-world environments.  It is comprised of a distributed simulation engine, visualizer, and programming interface through which developers create agent software and network topologies.  Communication between virtual nodes is also simulated, providing highly realistic scenarios.

\section{Test Approach and Constraints%
    \label{approach}%
}
    This section describes the overall approach, particular techniques and testing tools which will be used during the Acceptance Test Plan of the STAGE and any constraints that may apply.

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection{Test Objectives%
    \label{objectives}%
}
    The Acceptance Test Plan process will prompt the client to evaluate STAGE and verify whether it performs in accordance with the client’s requirements, listed in the Software Requirements Specification.

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection{Test Structure%
    \label{structure}%
}
    The Acceptance Test Plan will consist of a subset of test cases and methods, previously utilized in the Unit Tests, Integration Test and System Test conducted on the STAGE. The test cases will be carefully selected and agreed upon by both the developer and the client, and will allow for the most adequate verification of the functional requirements of the STAGE, as listed in the Software Requirements Document, without the extensiveness of the full-scale System Test.

    It is essential that all appropriate Unit Tests, Integration Test and the System Test were successfully performed for STAGE prior to the Acceptance Test Plan and their results were reported and presented to the client.

%___________________________________________________________________________

\section{Test Assumptions and Exclusions%
    \label{assumptions}%
}

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection{Introduction}
    This section provides greater details about what issues and features of STAGE will be covered by Acceptance Test Plan process, and what issues and features of STAGE will not be covered.

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection{Assumptions}
    It is assumed that all issues covered by the Acceptance Test Plan were also previously addressed by the Unit Tests, Integration Test and System Test of STAGE. The Acceptance Test Plan will cover:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The functional requirements of the system listed in the Software Requirements Specification
        \item Usability of the system
    \end{itemize}

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection{Exclusions}
    It is assumed that all issues not covered by the Acceptance Test Plan were previously addressed by Unit Tests, Integration Tests and System Tests of STAGE. The Acceptance Test Plan will not cover:
    \begin{itemize}   
        \item The non-functional requirements of the system (except the aforementioned Usability) listed in the Software Requirements Specification
        \item Structural integrity of the source code
    \end{itemize}
